          <h2>Notes on Weeks 1-4</h2>
          <hr>
          <p> Welcome to the first few weeks! Below is a detailed workout list of what everyday should look like for your workout. Every workout should take around 45 minutes to complete
            (it will vary on rest time between sets. But a good starting point is around 1 minute). Each day will begin with some cardio. The point of this is to get your body lose and
            to get a good sweat going so you will have less chance of injury when lifting weights later. As you can see, I made a link to some example stretches that you can refer to
            to help with avoiding injuries. Next, I will just do a quick break down of what each day will cover.
          </p>
          <p>Before the details, I should highlight the core groups that every lifter should know. 1) CHEST 2) LEGS 3) BACK. These are the core lifts that you will want to know by heart.
            They are core lifts because they use multiple muscles in order to perform the associated lift. Day 1 focuses on upper body by starting out with a core chest exercise. Like I said before,
            every workout is geared to be a full body workout but each is focused on a particular core lift for that day. Day 3 will focus on core leg exercises. And day 5 focuses on back. Now for
            rest days, you have nothing required of you. But if you are feeling sore from a previous workout, the worst thing you can do is sit around all day. I would strongly encourage on going for a
            jog outside or maybe a swim. Even going over and sitting in a hottub will have your body feeling much more relaxed. Most importantly, you should <strong> stretch </strong> on your days off!!
            You will thank yourself for doing it ahead of time rather than later. After building a fundamental base to your body, the next workouts will be less focused on full body workouts and more in specialization of one of the core lifts. But that is in
             the future. Let us focus on the now!!!
