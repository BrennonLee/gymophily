        <p> The purpose of these personalized workouts are to help provide you with a fundamental build that hits every muscle. That being said, every workout is designed
        to be a full body workout where each day has a special emphasis on a certain core muscle group such as legs, chest, or back. Before diving into this, I am going to cover a few topics that I find to be vital
        in order to be successful. These are suggestions and tips that I strongly encourage. Obviously, I cannot and will not force you to do any of these.</p>
        <p> To begin, I want to stress that the workout is maybe a third of the overall battle to getting in shape. <i>"Champions are made when no one is watching."</i>
        What really matters is what you do away from the gym and in your personal life. What I consider to be the two most important factors other than the gym is your <strong>diet</strong>
        and <strong>sleep</strong> schedule.</p>
        <h2> Diet </h2>
        <p>In your diet, it is recommended to consume approximately 0.4 grams of protein per pound of body weight per day (the whole 1 gram per pound of body weight is more of a myth. And like
            most things, too much of something can be harmful). But it is important to make sure your muscles have the fuel they need to be able to recover properly. Great ways to make
            sure you are getting protein can be not only from meats, but also dairy and nuts. Next time you want a snack, try a handful of almonds!! They are a great source of natural fats, potassium, and protein.
            When you are coming right out of a workout, I would strongly recommend investing in some sort of recovery drink. The most optimal time to consume protein is right after you walk out of the gym.
            Your muscles are torn down and the quicker you can get some protein into your body, the better recovery you will have. Lastly, I thoroughly believe in eating tons of fruits and vegtables.
            Obviously, it can be hard to have them for every meal so I will suggest starting with baby steps. Once a week, you should go out of your way to eat one healthy meal that is packed with
            vegetables, protein, grains, and a side of carbs. For great ideas on meals, I would suggest <a href="http://www.menshealth.com/tags/recipes" target="_blank">here</a>.
        </p>
        <h2> Sleep</h2>
        <p>
          Now it is obvious that we all need some amount of sleep. Some need more than others and some need less than others to be able to focus on the daily
          (sleep also varies due to metablic reasons). But when you get involved in training, the need for more sleep will rise over time. Which makes sense. The more active you are,
          the more your body will be broken down and the need to repair will rise which is done while sleeping. Specifically, recovery is done in the REM (Rapid Eye Movement) phase which
          takes between 1-2 hours for a person to enter this part of the cycle. To get a proper recovery, we want our bodies to go through multiple cycles in a night. The science boils down
          to having the average active althete to get around 7-8 hours of sleep per night.
